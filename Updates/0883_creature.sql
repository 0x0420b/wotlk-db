I don't know if this was new at some point, but you can turn in the quests inside BRD any any rep level. So with the going prices, 
from neutral to friendly is far cheaper if you buy (or farm) fiery core, lava core, and core leather.

This isn't new - the original way to gain reputation with Thorium Brotherhood was started through these turn in quests inside
 of Blackrock Depths and it was the only way to gain reputation. Dark Iron Ore wasn't even available outside of Molten Core 
 and Blackrock Depths. The Neutral - Honored quests at Thorium Point were added much later - when Thorium Point was added. 
 Dark Iron Ore was later added to the Searing Gorge and Burning Steppes areas to make it even more accessible.

Lokhtos sells his recipes depending on your faction with the Thorium Brotherhood.
(...)This means that he will only show what you have access to, NOT everything he sells. So, you have to be exalted to be able to see his whole list 
of purchaseables. Things you can't learn (since we can only have 2 profs) will still appear red no matter your rep. 
At friendly you'll only see the "friendly purchaseable" options. Where as, at honored you'll see honored and friendly ones, and soforth(...)
